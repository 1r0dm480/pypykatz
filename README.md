# pypykatz
Mimikatz implementation in pure Python
Currently aiming for full minidump functionality.

WARNING: This project is still work in progress, there is no guarantee that anything will stay/look/feel the same from one second to another.

# Prerequisites
Most of my big python projects are aiming for maximum protability, meaning I only use 3rd party packages where absolutely necessary. 
As of this point only one additional package is used, and I intend to keep it this way.
